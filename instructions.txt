The Snake
The Snake game is a collection of games related to the normal snake game as the player can use 'W/A/S/D'  to change the direction of the snake. The game ends when the snake hits the boundaries or itself. The snake can gain points by eating the grey bonus in the game. However, eating the bonus will cause the speed and the length of the snake to increase, which increases the difficulty of the game.

The game has different modes:
1. This's the most classic rules of playing Snake. 

2. Invincible mode as you will never die, not from hitting the boundaries or yourself.

3. While eating the bonus, another Snake will generate in the world randomly and move. You will die if you hit it. However, you can kill it by using a small trick if it hits your body.

4. The bonus for this mode will move in this world, you have to predict the movement of the bonus in order to eat it.

5. This is the most interesting mode I think in this game. When the snake eats the bonus, the head becomes the tail and the tail become the head. The direction of movement of the snake all changes too, so you have to be careful about not hitting the boundaries.

6. Barriers will generate frequently in this mode. You need to collect the special bonuses as many as possible in order to survive. You can destroy the barriers when you are in damage mode by eating orange bonus.
