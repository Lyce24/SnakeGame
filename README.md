# SnakeGame
The Snake game is a collection of games related to the normal snake game as the player can use 'W/A/S/D'  to change the direction of the snake. The game ends when the snake hits the boundaries or itself. The snake can gain points by eating the grey bonus in the game. However, eating the bonus will cause the speed and the length of the snake to increase, which increases the difficulty of the game.
